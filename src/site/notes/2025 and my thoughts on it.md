Well this has been an eventful year wasn't it? :D
# What have I been doing?
The whole year I've been working at a school as a "teacher". I've lost an almost two year old relationship. And as always I've improved as a person in many ways.
## The school
It has been moving in some ways that I am very happy about but also in ways that worry me. I feel like I've improved a lot as a teacher which makes me happy. My biggest issue still is my iresponsibility, I've improved a lot but still not good enough haha.
## Lost relationship
As sad as that may sound I am very happy about it, of course that is not how I felt when it happened few months back but looking back at all of it, it is better for everyone involved and I only regret not ending it sooner (for the record I was not the one to end it, but I should have been). And as always with love this allowed me to find a new person to give some to. I feel the expression "silver lining" is not enough here, it's more like gold lining lol.
## What has changed within me
It is hard to keep track of when what changes happened.
One of the main things I feel is I have gotten significantly more honest with both myself and the people who matter. I have also began to focus more on voting for the right things with my actions, my [[Privacy\|Privacy]] note is a good example of that.
# What's to come
Main thing that I can't keep my mind of is not a thing at all but a person. I've met M in July of 2025. She seems to be an incredible person and our so far undefined relationship has been flourishing. I don't mean to make you cringe dear reader, but she is what I thought was too much to ask of this world. She's mature, smart, weird, talented, determined, interesting and of course beautiful inside and out.
She will be visiting me in February this year (2026), I am beyond excited. I still can't believe she likes me and will fly over an ocean just to spend time with this asshole.
## Life plan
If you know me at all you know damn well there's no plan XD
But I have some rough idea of one:
- I'd like to remain working as a teacher and improve in being one. On that topic I'd like to start writing specific lessons here as notes, probably both in [[Lessons \| English]] and [[Lekce \| Czech]]. The goal of that is to share them with the public and maybe other teachers in our web of schools.
- I'd love to finally learn Java and write some MC and Hytale mods. I would also like to learn a bit of Lua to make Luanti games and teach the kids Lua so they can make Roblox games. And if there's time then learning a bit of Rust was always on my todo list.
- While we are on the topic of learning, a bit of French would be nice to know so I could speak the native tongue of M.
- I want to focus on building my relationship with M, which includes visiting her home country.
- I'd love to finally build my [[CM3588 home server\|CM3588 home server]] and focus on homelabbing and making my apartment (room) smarter.
## Online presence
I would like to expand my online presence just a bit:
- Finally get a personal website up and running: kynzo.org
- Start making videos to post on Odysee, PeerTube and YouTube
- Stream a bit more probably on twitch and if I manage to figure out how to on Odysee (maybe on all sorts of platforms)
- Post here wayy more
So stay tuned if you care about my content and what I offer! :D

Thank you for surviving 2025 with me, hope you had a lovely year and the next one will be even lovelier.
Have a good one!
