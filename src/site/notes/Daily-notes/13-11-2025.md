This is my first ever daily note! I've finally decided to start using obsidian, after discovering there's and easy sync solution called [syncthing](https://syncthing.net). If i actually manage to set it up idk, but it seems straight forward haha.
Today has been a pretty nice day, Valve announced it's new Steam hardware yesterday night. Looking up to adding to to my never ending [[Wishlist\|Wishlist]] haha.

Let's goo! I just managed to make the syncthing thingy work! I tink at least 😅
Hell yeahh! it worksss and seems to be working really well :D
Let's try if it works well when iam not on the same network :O
Yayyyy, it works i just had to enable it thru firewall on my fedora pc using this command: `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=syncthing --permanent` after that i just reloaded the firewall: `sudo firewall-cmd --reload` and it all just works! amazinggg

Nice! I've finished my [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] note for now, mentioning all the customization i did in it.
