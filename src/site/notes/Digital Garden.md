A plugin for [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] to publish notes easily and for free.

I've used [this guide](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/getting-started/01-getting-started/) to set it up.
The only extra thing I did was add a custom domain into Vercel:
- Go to https://vercel.com
- Click on your project's three dot menu > Manage Domains:

- Click "Add Domain" and then type in your domain (garden.kynzo.org in my case)
- After that it will give you an error: Invalid Configuration, click on learn more and add an DNS record in your domain provider like it says.
- You can also either remove the old domain or change it to redirect to the new one
