This is an introduction into programming using the programming language [Hedy](https://hedy.org).
Hedy is a language made for learning, as you progress you learn to use the correct syntax and advanced functions, until it slowly transforms into [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Python is a well known language and even tho it isn't as powerful and efficient as some other ones, it is a great language to start with for its simplicity.
It is used for making plugins/addons/bots for many platforms like:
- Discord (bots)
- Blender 3D (scripting)
- Krita/GIMP (Plugins)
- Minecraft Java (Mods are made in Java, but there is many Mods that allow you to use Python to script things into the game)
- Sims 4 (Mods)
And many big companies use Python to this day for some backend work (eg. YouTube, Spotify..)
