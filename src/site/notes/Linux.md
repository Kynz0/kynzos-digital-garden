Linux my beloved.
# Why use Linux
I mean that is the main question that people sometimes ask themselves. Why use something when something else works for me? Why learn some new complicated OS when [[Windows\|Windows]] has been working just fine for me?
The simplest answer I can give is: That you think something is good does not make it good.
In our case Windows and you using it is causing you a lot of direct and indirect harm that you aren't connecting to your other problems. It is spying on you, stealing your data, and supporting many bad things that are making your life much worse. (In short one of the main concerns is [[Privacy\|Privacy]])
## But I don't even like computers!
I hear many people say this. They always tell me that they don't like windows either and that they just don't care and only use a PC because they absolutely have to.
If you think this, fuck you. You are lying to yourself and me. You want to use computers and technology, you wouldn't want to live a week without it, you are just lazy to invest some time and learn the tool that has been making your life so much easier.
And just to prove my point let's assume you aren't lying. Go on then, stop using PC's and tech. Go to the bank every time you need to take out money, or better yet just have all your savings at your home. Go on start a company that does all the paperwork on paper and files everything manually. Stop communicating with people using your phone and instead only talk to them when you see them or via a pigeon. Go in the library and spend 30 minutes there every time you need to google something. No one is forcing you to use anything, there are alternatives, we have been without this technology for as long as we know we exist.
## So what makes Windows so bad?
Firstly it is closed sourced and completely controlled by the american company Microsoft.
What that means is that you actually can't know what is happening inside your computer. So it is up to them to decide if they are gonna steal and misuse your data, and let me tell you Microsoft has not shown any kind of motivation to care about it's users. Only thing they showed they care about is profits. Do you really think they would't misuse your data in every possible way with no consequences if they make money of of it?
Besides that there are many other reasons why I think Windows is just plain worse, but those tend to be a bit more subjective and honestly the first reason should just be enough for you to start learning and slowly transitioning into using Linux, if you care about yourself and those around you (especially if you have kids and care about this world's future for them).
## Why Linux then? What makes it better then Windows?
Linux is completely [[FOSS\|FOSS]] thus open-source. Meaning that if you don't trust the Linux foundation then you can just go and read what is running on your machine. Of course realistically almost no one does that, but few nerds do and if they found something bad it would be well known and would ruin Linux's reputation (or the specific distribution's reputation).
Honestly as much as I personally like Linux I don't think it's that perfect. But it is the only good alternative out there. The only second one that's kind of well known is BSD, which has even less hardware and software support then Linux does.
Maybe somewhere in the distant future we will have a better alternative but my somewhat educated guess is that won't happen anytime soon.
# So how do I Linux?
Well firstly you'll need something to install Linux on. Even tho yes it is possible to install Linux on so many devices, realistically you'll need a x86 cpu to start with. That is the classic cpu in most PC's, rule of the thumb is if you're running Windows it can run Linux.
Now unfortunately not all hardware is compatible with Linux so you **might** need to give up a fingerprint reader or something similar to use it.
Another pain point is Nvidia, if you have a Nvidia gpu then your Linux journey will be that much more painful. It's really a hit and miss with Nvidia gpu's but if you have a modern one and a good attitude you should be fine (it's good to note that I've heard people of having zero problems with it and also people who didn't manage to get it to work at all, so it is kind of a gamble). With all that said I highly recommend a modern AMD gpu.
Last thing you'll need is a decent usb flash drive and you are good to go!
I am not gonna give you the whole tutorial for how to install Linux as there's thousands if not millions out there at this point.
I'm just gonna give you some recommendations for starters:
- Dual-boot, this means to have both windows and linux on the same pc. It is crucial as in the start you might not be able to use your pc effectively enough and you'll end up switching
- Don't take too much time choosing a distro. Just pick one, you'll pick the wrong one for you anyways.. Learn Linux with experience and make a good choice after that. If you still aren't sure just use any of the available distro pickers
- My personal favorite that I will be talking about the most here is Fedora, it is very much general use, runs good on older and newer hardware, and has many images for many desktop environments. UBlue images that are based on fedora are also very decent if you don't care much for Linux and just want something that works
