The so called "second brain" :D I've heard a lot about this app and I'm excited to see if it will deliver on it's promises.

# List of things I setup for my obsidian:
- [[Syncthing\|Syncthing]] automatic syncing from my phone to my pc (you can use it for however devices you'd like), unlike the obsidian sync this is completely free and decentralized.
- [[Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]] is a website where I can publish my obsidian notes! It was fairly easy to setup and run's on my custom domain (kynzo.org): [[kynzo's Digital Garden\|kynzo's Digital Garden]]
- [[Created and updated dates\|Created and updated dates]] just a little somethings that automatically adds the created and updated dates into the properties of each note
- [[Map View Plugin\|Map View Plugin]] is quite useful for mentioning exact places or creating notes with location in the properties
