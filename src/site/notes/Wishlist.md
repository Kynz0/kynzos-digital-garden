This is a list of things that kynzo would like to own one day :D

- [Steam Machine](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine)
- 2 or more [Steam Controllers](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamcontroller)
- [CM3588 Plus](https://www.friendlyelec.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=60&product_id=299) 32GB ram - 64/256GB eMMC, with the CM3588 NAS Kit, 12V 4A power adapter bough separately as it is much cheaper
- phone that supports [[GrapheneOS\|GrapheneOS]], not a pixel but the new ones that graphene devs have been working with as stated [here](https://discuss.grapheneos.org/d/25099-pixel-10-experimental-support-for-grapheneos-is-now-available/248)
- [Flipper zero](https://shop.flipperzero.one/products/flipper-zero)
- [Flipper One]() for when it comes out
- A [[Framework\|Framework]] laptop, not sure which one yet (This is more of a long-term wish, in the near future I plan to own and use a ThinkPad)
- A good old but still powerful reliable ThinkPad (probably a second hand T480 with a i5-i7 8th gen cpu)
- [Phasmophobia music box](https://themusicbox.store/products/phasmophobia-music-box?variant=42662291963952)
- Pins, so many [[Pins that I'd like to own one day\|pins]].
