# What is a digital garden?
[[Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]] is a plugin for [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] that allows me to easily choose notes from my vault that I want to publish on this website.

# Who is kynzo
Welp **I** am a subjectively weird 19 year old (born 2006) guy that was born and as of 2025 still lives in Czech republic. More on me here: [[kynzo\|kynzo]].
