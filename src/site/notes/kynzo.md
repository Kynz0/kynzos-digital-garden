I'll try my best to explain who kynzo is in this note in some more simple shorter sections, that will then link to my hobbies, ideals and so on for longer more in depth paragraphs.

### Nickname
So how did I even start calling myself "kynzo" in the first place? My first phone that I've had after my father was the [Verzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verzo) Kinzo. I needed to name my new email something to buy minecraft on this phone and so we've decided to name it "[censored].kinzo" (censored is a short version of my first name). Few years after that I've needed to name my java Minecraft account something and at that point I've decided that Kynzo with an Y just looks better.
In 2023 I've decided to stop capitalizing the K, because... it looks cooler.
