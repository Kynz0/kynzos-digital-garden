I'll try my best to explain who kynzo is in this note in some more simple shorter sections, that will then link to my hobbies, ideals and so on for longer more in depth paragraphs.
# Nickname
So how did I even start calling myself "kynzo" in the first place? My first phone that I've had after my father was the [Verzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verzo) Kinzo. I needed to name my new email something to buy minecraft on this phone and so we've decided to name it "~~censored~~.kinzo" (censored is a short version of my first name). Few years after that I've needed to name my java Minecraft account something and at that point I've decided that Kynzo with an Y just looks better.
In 2023 I've decided to stop capitalizing the K, because... it looks cooler.
# Hobbies
As of right now I would split my hobbies into four main categories:
- Exercise/health: I really enjoy working out for the last couple of years, I've made some significant progress that I am quite proud of. With that also comes eating somewhat healthy and cooking my own food, which is also intertwined with the next category.
- Homesteading/off-grid living: I've always loved the idea of living independently whether that was from my parents, other people or the society. Only recently I've did more research and started realizing that it isn't as impossible/hard as i believed it to be. I hope to own a [[The house\|house]] one day with some decent land and take care of all my needs myself.
- FOSS/Linux: for a few years now I've fallen in love with the idea of surrounding myself with FOSS software for freedom, privacy and customizability. I've been daily driving [[Fedora\|Fedora]] for some time now, but I've tried Arch, Bazzite, Ubuntu and many others in the past.
- Debating/Ideology: This one is the hardest to explain. I really enjoy debating all kinds of things when it comes to the world, from the smallest most insignificant to huge alarming issues of our society. I believe I have some pretty [[kynzo#My view on this world and it's people\|interesting views]] on many matters especially for a 19 year old (as of 2025).
# Projects/companies I like/support
- [[Linux\|Linux]] - operating system (like Windows or MacOS) that is [[FOSS\|FOSS]] and respects your [[Privacy\|Privacy]].
- [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] - simple yet feature rich markdown based note taking app, used to write this very note.
- [[Valve/Steam\|Valve]] - the company behind [[Valve/Steam\|Steam]]. Not quite opensource but I agree with many things they do (not all).
- [[Framework\|Framework]] - primarily a laptop company that makes very repairable and customizable laptops.
- [[Fairphone\|Fairphone]] - European based phone brand that makes very repairable and ethically sourced phones.
- [[Signal\|Signal]] - a messenger app similar to something like WhatsApp, but actually secure, opensource and trustworthy
# My view on this world and it's people
Contrary to a lot of people's that know me believes, I have a quite negative view on everything. Why they think otherwise? Well I certainly don't act like someone with such views, in fact I tend to act like someone with a very positive outlook on everything.
Why is that? Well you know how in some games or software you can sometimes trick the game by subtracting from zero and the number rolls all the way to like 32 million due to how signed integers work on computers?
Well that is kind of what happened with my view on this world, it is so incredibly negative that it made me realize how much things just don't matter and the only thing I can do is either extract myself from society or just live here and try and make this the world I would actually like to live in. Obviously as of right now I am still here.. I've decided to stay for now as I can leave whenever I'd like to, so there's no hurry.
But as nice as that sounds do not be mistaken, I dislike or even hate almost everything in this world and especially people. People are the worst out of all because they are the only ones with the ability to change things for themselves and others yet they either do nothing or usually make everything even worse, while lying to themselves about how they aren't horrible and using the "Hitler excuse" saying their are people who do things soo much worse then them so they aren't so bad.
